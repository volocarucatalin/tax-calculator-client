  <h2>3. Check Subcontractor-Specific Reports</h2>
  <p>Visit the <strong>Reports</strong> section to review:</p>

    <h1>Welcome to the Tax Calculator Client</h1>
    <p>As a subcontractor, you can use this platform to stay informed about your jobs, payments, and tax deductions. Follow the steps below to understand how this tool helps you track your financials.</p>

    <h2>1. Create Your Invoice</h2>
    <p>Start by creating your invoice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the <strong>Invoice</strong> section in the application.</li>
      <li>You will see a list of invoices including:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Job Name</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Number of Days Worked</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Payment Rate</strong> per day.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Check Invoices</h2>
    <p>Each job has an invoice associated with it. You can view the details of these invoices, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total Payment:</strong> Calculated based on the days worked and the daily payment rate.</li>
      <li><strong>Tax Deduction (20%):</strong> The tax amount deducted from your earnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Net Receivable Amount:</strong> The amount you will receive after tax deductions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Monitor Payments</h2>
    <p>The system tracks the status of your payments. You can see whether an invoice is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Paid:</strong> The payment has been completed and transferred to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Unpaid:</strong> The payment is still pending.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you see discrepancies, contact your contractor directly for resolution.</p>

    <h2>4. Understand Tax Deductions</h2>
    <p>The platform calculates taxes based on your earnings for each job. Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Total Payment = <strong>Days Worked × Payment Rate</strong></li>
      <li>Tax = <strong>20% of Total Payment</strong></li>
      <li>Net Receivable = <strong>Total Payment - Tax</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="example-box">
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>You work on <strong>Job A</strong> for <strong>5 days</strong> with a daily payment rate of <strong>$200</strong>. Here are the calculations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Payment:</strong> 5 × $200 = $1000</li>
        <li><strong>Tax Deduction (20%):</strong> $1000 × 0.2 = $200</li>
        <li><strong>Net Receivable:</strong> $1000 - $200 = $800</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will receive $800 once payment is marked as <strong>Paid</strong> by the contractor.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>5. View Tax Reports</h2>
    <p>You can view detailed tax reports that include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Total taxes deducted across all jobs.</li>
      <li>Net earnings after tax deductions.</li>
      <li>Detailed breakdowns for each invoice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Keep Your Profile Updated</h2>
    <p>Ensure your details, such as your <strong>Unique Tax Reference (UTR)</strong> and contact information, are updated in the system. This ensures smooth operations and accurate tax calculations.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How is the tax calculated?</strong> The system automatically applies a flat 20% tax deduction on your total payment.</li>
      <li><strong>What if there’s an issue with my payment?</strong> Contact your contractor for resolution or further updates.</li>
    </ul>
